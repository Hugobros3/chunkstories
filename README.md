# Chunk Stories

### A Voxel Games Framework

Chunk Stories is a fully-featured voxel game engine written in Java and Kotlin, aiming to replace Minecraft/MCP as a modding framework to build mods and total conversions. It features almost everything the original game could do, but is built in a modular and open fashion : everything is strictly either part of the game engine or runtime content. Mods are, by design, first-class citizens, and any number of them can be loaded at the same time, without ever requiring a game restart. A server can host it's own custom mods and have the clients download them upon connection. It's basically gmod for Minecraft !

The project consists of an API, an implementation of that API in the form of client and server executables and everything else is just mods loaded at runtime. A base mod called "chunkstories-core" or just "core" is bundled with the engine to give content creators a solid base upon which to build the gamemode of their dreams. It comes with most basic bloc types a Minecraft clone is expected to have: dirt, stone, wood, glass, chests, doors etc.

### Why yet another Minecraft clone ?

It may have occured to you that a while ago, some company known by the name 'Microsoft' spent more than what a few countries GDP to aquire the rights to the videogame 'Minecraft', to the astonishment of observers and fears of some faitfull players. More recently their strategy has become increasingly clear: they are using the brand to promote their other products, and are phasing out the relativly open, and beloved so-called "Java Edition". Replacing it is effectively a port of the C++/C# console remake, exclusive to the platforms where Microsoft *allows* it to run and where modding is severely limited.

Chunk Stories is free software and runs on any platform someone can be bothered to port the implementation to.

#### You didn't answer the question. There already are multiple open minecraft clones!

For the author, Chunk Stories is and always has been a side project, made for fun and to become a better programmer. This is the main quest. The author also has the smug belief that other clones are flawed in some way, and he can do better, especially in the mods handling department. ( [Yes, that](https://xkcd.com/927/) )

To this end, Chunk Stories borrows heavily from one of two best things about the Minecraft modding ecosystem: The Bukkit-style of plugins, and the server-downloadable "resource packs", mixing the two into the idea of a "Mod". Mods are merely zip files with resources ( images, 3d models, sounds, text files ) and code ( inside jars ), and are very simple to both build and use.

### Main engine features

 * Support for basically loading everything at runtime, with downloading at server connection time
 * Uses text files with simple syntax for content definitions (Blocks, Items, Entities, Particles, etc)
 * Advanced graphics with a rendergraph-based renderer
    * **Vulkan** and OpenGL 3.3* backends
    * Very high view distances, to 1km and above via heightmaps
    * Simple data-oriented API for having objects drawn on the screen and passing data to shaders
    * Advanced lighting via shadow mapping, deffered rendering and experimental PBR\*
    * Experimental voxel global illumination\*
 * Multiplayer, with dedicated servers and the ability to serve mods
 * Worlds are wrap-arround style, with currently up to (64km)Â² maps
 * Entities and voxels use Components to store data and organize their logic
 * Built-in support for AABB physics, skeletal animations, Hitboxes and more
 * DPI-agnostic UI with seamless scaling
 * Works on Windows and Linux ( OSX may work but is unsupported )

\* some stuff *might* not be quite done right now

### Building chunkstories

*This is for building `chunkstories`, the core engine. If you are only looking to write mods, you do not have to mess with this at all and should rather follow the [mods creation guide](http://chunkstories.xyz/wiki/doku.php?id=mod_setup) on the project Wiki !*

##### Brief Instructions

First you need to clone both `chunkstories-api` and `chunkstories-core` as both are needed to compile this. You can try to build from the artifacts in the repo, but only those used in released versions of the games are guaranteed to be present.
 * `git clone` both `chunkstories-api` and `chunkstories-core`
 * in the chunkstories-api folder: `./gradlew install` or `gradlew.exe install`on Windows
 * in the chunkstories-core folder: `./gradlew install` or `gradlew.exe install`on Windows

The local maven repository on your computer (.m2 folder) now contains copies of both the api and core content the chunkstories engine requires. These are not automatically rebuilt when building the implementation as they are completly seperate projects, so keep that in mind.

#### Gradle Tasks

 * `./gradlew client:shadowJar` builds the Client executable (chunkstories.jar)
 * `./gradlew server:shadowJar` builds the Server executable (server.jar)
 * `./gradlew converter:shadowJar` builds the Map converter executable (converter.jar)
 * `./gradlew launcher:createExe` builds the launcher executables (.exe and .jar as well)
 * `./gradlew buildAll` builds all of the above
